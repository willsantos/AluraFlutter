A new Flutter project developed in Alura's courses:

At first, I believed that the entire training would be a single project, but there are some
ramifications, and courses that start on a previous branch. That way my original organizing idea
failed, so I splited each course into a branch without adding the main.

This repository has many changes because in parallel with the Flutter courses I was improving
my knowledge of GIT.
